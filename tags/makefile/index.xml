With my full stack skillset, I can create (or update) a website, webapp, or Android app from start to finish.
Programming Languages I know the following languages:
Python including Tensorflow and other machine learning and data science tools. JavaScript including ES6, NodeJS, and other web development tools C C++, including Qt and the language QML Java Haskell Elm Lisp Rust I have experience with the Linux operating system.</description></item><item><title>Tutoring</title><link>/tutoring/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Oct 2019 19:10:58 -0700</pubDate><guid>/tutoring/</guid><description>I am your math, language, and programming tutor Qualifications: I worked as a tutor at the Computer Science department of the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology for two years. I have a degree in mathematics and a degree in computer science from the same school, where I graduated with a 3.5 GPA in 4.5 years. I tutored middle-school as part of the Growing Up Thinking Scientifically (GUTS) program and high-school students in the Supercomputing Challenge.</description></item><item><title>Parser and Interpreter in OCaml</title><link>/projects/hrclox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Jul 2018 20:21:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/hrclox/</guid><description>Lox interpreter written in OCaml by Hugo O.

Uses C for preprocessing emails, Python for parsing and extracting low-level features of emails, and a few lines of Matlab for running several classic classifiers.
See github.com/roguh/email-classifier
Hopfield testing These Python scripts can be used to test the recall effectiveness of Hopfield Networks. A sample dataset composed of the Walsh vectors, an orthogonal system is included by default.</description></item><item><title>cv-composer</title><link>/projects/cv-composer/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2016 21:49:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/cv-composer/</guid><description>Command-line based computer vision algorithms showcase.
