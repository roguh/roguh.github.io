Over France a few German fighter plans flew at them backwards, sucked bullets and shell fragments from some of the planes and crewmen. They did the same for wrecked American bombers on the ground, and those planes flew up backwards to join the formation.<p>The formation flew backwards over a German city that was in flames. The bombers opened their bomb bay doors, exerted a miraculous magnetism which shrunk the fires, gathered them into cylindrical steel containers, and lifted the containers into the bellies of the planes. The containers were stored neatly in racks. The Germans below had miraculous devices of their own, which were long steel tubes. They used them to suck more fragments from the crewmen and planes. But there were still a few wounded Americans, though, and some of the bombers were in bad repair. Over France, though, German fighters came up again, made everything and everybody good as new.<p>When the bombers got back to their base, the steel cylinders were taken from the racks and shipped back to the United States of America, where factories were operating night and day, dismantling the cylinders, separating the dangerous contents into minerals. Touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. The minerals were then shipped to specialists in remote areas. It was their business to put them into the ground, to hide them cleverly so they would never hurt anybody ever again.</div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-3 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-3>1995 Cold War thriller Crimson Tide</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-3 class=outline-text-2><p>“We’re here to preserve democracy, not to practice it.”</div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-4 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-4>Pushing Daises, Pie-lette 2007</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-4 class=outline-text-2><p>Ned: I'm not a fan of the hug.

Most especially must I tread with care in matters of life and death. If it is given me to save a life, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to take a life; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.<p>I will remember that I do not treat a fever chart, a cancerous growth, but a sick human being, whose illness may affect the person’s family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for the sick.<p>I will prevent disease whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to cure.<p>I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm.<p>If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of healing those who seek my help.<p>—Written in 1964 by Louis Lasagna, Academic Dean of the School of Medicine at Tufts University, and used in many medical schools today</div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-6 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-6>Rocannon's World by Ursula K Le Guin</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-6 class=outline-text-2><p>"You're not master here.

And they're dangerous times. But here's the good news. In two months we have the chance, not the certainty but the chance, to restore some semblance of sanity to our politics. Because there is actually only one real check on bad policy and abuses of power, and that's you. You and your vote. …<p>I happen to be a Democrat. I support Democratic candidates. I believe our policies are better and that we have a bigger, bolder vision of opportunity and equality and justice and inclusive democracy. We know there are a lot of jobs young people aren't getting a chance to occupy or aren't getting paid enough or aren't getting benefits like insurance. It's harder for young people to save for a rainy day, let alone retirement. So Democrats aren't just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage, they're running on good new ideas like Medicare for all, giving workers seats on corporate boards, reversing the most egregious corporate tax cuts to make sure college students graduate debt-free. …<p>Making democracy work means holding on to our principles, having clarity about our principles, and then having the confidence to get in the arena and have a serious debate. And it also means appreciating that progress does not happen all at once, but when you put your shoulder to the wheel, if you're willing to fight for it, things do get better. And let me tell you something, particularly young people here. Better is good. I used to have to tell my young staff this all the time in the White House. Better is good. That's the history of progress in this country. Not perfect. Better. The Civil Rights Act didn't end racism, but it made things better. Social Security didn't eliminate all poverty for seniors, but it made things better for millions of people.<p>Do not let people tell you the fight's not worth it because you won't get everything that you want. The idea that, well, you know there's racism in America so I'm not going to bother voting. No point. That makes no sense. You can make it better. Better's always worth fighting for. …<p>I am hopeful because out of this political darkness I am seeing a great awakening of citizenship all across the country. I cannot tell you how encouraged I've been by watching so many people get involved for the first time, or the first time in a long time. They're marching and they're organizing and they're registering people to vote, and they're running for office themselves. Look at this crop of Democratic candidates running for Congress and running for governor, running for the state legislature, running for district attorney, running for schoolboard. It is a movement of citizens who happen to be younger and more diverse and more female than ever before…<p>we've got first-time candidates, we've got veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, record numbers of women – Americans who previously maybe didn't have an interest in politics as a career, but laced up their shoes and rolled up their sleeves and grabbed a clipboard because they too believe, this time's different; this moment's too important to sit out. And if you listen to what these candidates are talking about, in individual races across the country, you'll find they're not just running against something, they are running for something. They're running to expand opportunity and they're running to restore the honor and compassion that should be the essence of public service.<p>And speaking as a Democrat, that's when the Democratic Party has always made the biggest difference in the lives of the American people, when we led with conviction and principle and bold new ideas. The antidote to a government controlled by a powerful fear, a government that divides, is a government by the organized, energized, inclusive many. That's what this moment's about. That has to be the answer. You cannot sit back and wait for a saviour. You can't opt out because you don't feel sufficiently inspired by this or that particular candidate. This is not a rock concert, this is not Coachella. You don't need a messiah. All we need are decent, honest, hardworking people who are accountable – and who have America's best interests at heart.<p>And they'll step up and they'll join our government and they will make things better if they have support. One election will not fix everything that needs to be fixed, but it will be a start. And you have to start it. What's going to fix our democracy is you.<p>People ask me, what are you going to do for the election? No, the question is: What are you going to do? You're the antidote. Your participation and your spirit and your determination, not just in this election but in every subsequent election, and in the days between elections.<p>Because in the end, the threat to our democracy doesn't just come from Donald Trump or the current batch of Republicans in Congress or the Koch Brothers and their lobbyists, or too much compromise from Democrats, or Russian hacking. The biggest threat to our democracy is indifference. The biggest threat to our democracy is cynicism - a cynicism that's led too many people to turn away from politics and stay home on Election Day. To all the young people who are here today, there are now more eligible voters in your generation than in any other, which means your generation now has more power than anybody to change things. If you want it, you can make sure America gets out of its current funk. If you actually care about it, you have the power to make sure we seize a brighter future. But to exercise that clout, to exercise that power, you have to show up.<p>In the last midterm election, fewer than one in five young people voted. One in five. Not two in five, or three in five. One in five. Is it any wonder this Congress doesn't reflect your values and your priorities? Are you surprised by that?<p>This whole project of self-government only works if everybody's doing their part. Don't tell me your vote doesn't matter. I've won states in the presidential election because of five, ten, twenty votes per precinct. And if you thought elections don't matter, I hope these last two years have corrected that impression.<p>So if you don't like what's going on right now – and you shouldn't – do not complain. Don't hashtag. Don't get anxious. Don't retreat. Don't binge on whatever it is you're bingeing on. Don't lose yourself in ironic detachment. Don't put your head in the sand. Don't boo. Vote. …<p>If you're tired of politicians who offer nothing but "thoughts and prayers" after a mass shooting, you've got to do what the Parkland kids are doing. Some of them aren't even eligible to vote, yet they're out there working to change minds and registering people, and they're not giving up until we have a Congress that sees your lives as more important than a campaign check from the NRA.<p>You've got to vote. When you vote, you've got the power to make it easier to afford college, and harder to shoot up a school. When you vote, you've got the power to make sure a family keeps its health insurance; you could save somebody's life. …<p>Thirty minutes of your time. Is democracy worth that? We have been through much darker times than these, and somehow each generation of Americans carried us through to the other side. Not by sitting around and waiting for something to happen, not by leaving it to others to do something, but by leading that movement for change themselves. And if you do that, if you get involved, and you get engaged, and you knock on some doors, and you talk with your friends, and you argue with your family members, and you change some minds, and you vote, something powerful happens.<p>Change happens. Hope happens. Not perfection. Not every bit of cruelty and sadness and poverty and disease suddenly stricken from the earth. There will still be problems. But with each new candidate that surprises you with a victory that you supported, a spark of hope happens. With each new law that helps a kid read or helps a homeless family find shelter or helps a veteran get the support he or she has earned, each time that happens, hope happens. With each new step we take in the direction of fairness and justice and equality and opportunity, hope spreads.<p>And that can be the legacy of your generation. You can be the generation that at a critical moment stood up and reminded us just how precious this experiment in democracy really is, just how powerful it can be when we fight for it, when we believe in it. I believe in you. I believe you will help lead us in the right direction. And I will be right there with you every step of the way.<div id=outline-container-headline-16 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-16>striking</h3><div id=outline-text-headline-16 class=outline-text-3><p>You have to start it.

· edited 9 hours ago<p>I translated a great text I found on facebook, from Luis Felipe Miguel, political science professor at UnB.<p>Come to think of it, I guess I’ll be able to get through a “bolsonarian” era.<p>I’m a male. I’m straight. I’m what’s called “white”, in Brazil.<p>If I don’t wear my red shirt, nobody is going to assault me on the street.<p>I can stop talking about Brazil and be back to just work on political theory. Maybe I’ll have to use one or two euphemisms, but, at large, they won’t understand what I’m saying anyway.<p>They’ll indeed cut my research funds. But looking on the bright side: it’s less work to do. They’ll also cut my researcher fellowship, but I can compensate that as I’ll pay less taxes with Paulo Guedes’ tax reform, which the poor will pay even more, and the rich even less.<p>I’ll see my students decreasing, as the inclusion policies are being dismantled and scholar tuition will be charged. It’s also less work to do. The university is going to be grayer, more silent, lifeless, but I can always take refuge at home.<p>But my home will also become more silent and grayer. And some of my friends won’t have the same luck as me, and will disappear: they have the wrong skin color, they drive their affection to the wrong people, they say the wrong words. Maybe it’s even better. In time to come, friendships might be dangerous.<p>If artists are getting silenced, it’s alright: there are so many classics I have yet find out!<p>I don’t know how to shoot, but I have money to buy a pistol and a flashy holster, so I can show off my Good Citizen status.<p>Yes, I may survive. Unlike what happens to many others, there is no risk to my physical integrity, my life or my material survival. All it takes is for me to mind my own business. All it takes is for me to become insensitive to all suffering around me. All it takes is for me to betray people I like. All it takes is for me to give up my dignity, my humanity, the possibility of facing myself in the mirror. All it takes is for me to become a monster.</div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-46 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-46>Eat when you can, sleep when you must, and never fuck with the pancreas</h2></div><div id=outline-container-headline-47 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-47>It is better to conquer yourself than to win a thousand battles.

I’m white and grew up in a trailer park. I make six figures now and my career path has been propped up by people who look like me giving my promotions and cops who look like me letting me off with warnings when I was a kid.<p>Brown folks suffer much more from generational poverty, DA and judicial “discretion”, etc. It’s just what it is. A rising tide that brings up our most oppressed (brown folk) is going to raise us all (poor white folk).<p>Be an ally y’all.<p>FFS:<p>Ok. Accepting your privilege doesn’t mean being burdened by guilt. Chill, y’all.<p>Privilege is: if when you are playing monopoly and when your fellow player gets to pull from community chest they pull 1 card. You get to pull 2 cards.<p>Doesn’t mean you won’t ever go to jail. But you are twice as likely to have a get out of jail free card. It means you are more likely to have the judge find in your favor and award you $400.<p>It means you were more likely, not certain, to start the game owning 3 rail roads. Meanwhile your homie is born on Baltic Ave.<p>Accepting your privilege is not accepting guilt it’s accepting power. You are not responsible for the rules - but you are responsible for your behavior within their context.<p>For example: Are you in charge of hiring? If so, does the diversity of your staff reflect that of your community and customer base? Will you call an applicant if you are unsure how to pronounce their ethnic name? Are there women who would celebrate you as a mentor?<p>Again, y’all - be an ally.<p>Again, and slowly - advocating for the well being of others takes absolutely fucking nothing from your own personal well being and will in fact enrich your life.<p>Source: the Bible, the Old Testament, the Koran, and my grandpa. Of coarse, you’d need to be selective with all 4.<p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.

Ground the possession of which imports great advantage to either side, is contentious ground. #

Ground which forms the key to three contiguous states, so that he who occupies it first has most of the Empire at his command, is a ground of intersecting highways.
When an army has penetrated into the heart of a hostile country, leaving a number of fortified cities in its rear, it is serious ground.
Mountain forests, rugged steeps, marshes and fens—all country that is hard to traverse: this is difficult ground. #
Ground which is reached through narrow gorges, and from which we can only retire by tortuous paths, so that a small number of the enemy would suffice to crush a large body of our men: this is hemmed in ground.
Ground on which we can only be saved from destruction by fighting without delay, is desperate ground.</div></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-65 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-65>The Grand Strategy of the Roman Empire by Edward Luttwak</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-65 class=outline-text-2><div id=outline-container-headline-66 class=outline-3><h3 id=headline-66>Once the empire was no longer sustained by the logic of collective security, it could only endure because of the unsustainable will of its rulers, and by men's waning <strong>fear of the unknown</strong></h3></div></div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-67 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-67>The Internet is the first thing that humanity has built that humanity doesn’t understand, the largest experiment in anarchy that we have ever had.</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-67 class=outline-text-2><p>-Eric Schmidt, Google</div></div><div id=outline-container-headline-68 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-68>"If you awaken in our time, you awaken with a sob." ~Steven Jenkinson</h2></div><div id=outline-container-headline-69 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-69>"This is a fight for the soul of our democracy; nothing less, and so I'm going to work hard to make sure we save that democracy, and I will fight until I die." -Elijah Cummings</h2></div><div id=outline-container-headline-70 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-70>You can’t make a silk purse out of a sow’s ear</h2></div><div id=outline-container-headline-71 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-71>if you want to go fast, go alone. if you want to go far, go together</h2></div><div id=outline-container-headline-72 class=outline-2><h2 id=headline-72>Democracy to Corporatocracy</h2><div id=outline-text-headline-72 class=outline-text-2><p>They rose from the shadows in the street.<p>From the places where the oppressed meet.<p>Their cries echoed loudly through the air.<p>As they once did in Tiananmen Square.<p>Loudness in the silence, Darkness in the light.<p>They came forth with power and might.<p>Once the beacon of democracy, America was first.<p>Its pillars of society destroyed and dispersed.<p>Soon the cries rose everywhere, with revolt and riot.<p>Until one day, finally, all was quiet.<p>From the ashes rose a new order, corporatocracy was its name.<p>Rome, Mongol, Byzantine, all of history is just the same.<p>For man will never change in a fundamental way.<p>And now democracy is dead, in the USA.</div></div></div><footer></footer></article></section></div><footer class=footer><section class=container><p><a id=to-top href=#top-of-page>To top of page ↑</a><nav class=menu><ul><li><a href=../intro.equipo.2021.11><span>A brief intro to computer science and programming</span></a><li><a href=../aliases/><span>Aliases + Names</span></a><li><a href=../contact/><span>Contact Information</span></a><li><a href=../mirrors><span>Content mirrors</span></a><li><a class=active href=../media.quotes_and_poems/><span>Quotes, notable snippets</span></a><li><a href=https://www.goodreads.com/roguh><span>See my favorite books on Goodreads</span></a><li><a href=https://www.imdb.com/list/ls095903632><span>See my favorite movies on IMDB</span></a></ul></nav><p><p>Hugo O.
